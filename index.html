        <h2>What is the difference between the usage of HTML and CSS?</h2>
        <p>
          HTML and CSS are complementary languages, meaning that they work
          together to create visually appealing and functional web pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>HTML</strong> is used to define the structure of a web page,
          such as the headings, paragraphs, and images.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CSS</strong> is used to style the appearance of a web page,
          such as the font, color, and size of the text.

          What is the difference between semantic and non-semantic elements?
        </h2>
        <p>
          In HTML, semantic elements are those that have a specific meaning or purpose. They are used to define the structure of a web page and to convey information about the content. For example, the h1 tag is a semantic element that is used to define a heading. The p tag is another semantic element that is used to define a paragraph.</p>

          <p>Non-semantic elements are those that do not have a specific meaning or purpose. They are used to control the layout of a web page or to add formatting to the content. For example, the div tag is a non-semantic element that is used to create a division or section of a web page. The span tag is another non-semantic element that is used to apply formatting to a piece of text.</p>

          <p>The main difference between semantic and non-semantic elements is that semantic elements provide meaning to the content, while non-semantic elements do not. This means that semantic elements are more useful for search engines and other assistive technologies.</p>

          <h3>Why do we prefer using semantic elements?</h3>
          <p><strong>They make the code more readable and maintainable.</strong> Semantic elements make it easier to understand the structure of a web page and to make changes to the code. This is because the meaning of the content is conveyed by the tags themselves, rather than by the surrounding text.</p>
        </p>
        <p><strong>They are more accessible to search engines and assistive technologies.</strong> Search engines and assistive technologies can use semantic elements to understand the content of a web page and to provide better results to users. For example, a search engine can use the h1 tag to identify the main heading of a web page, and an assistive technology can use the img tag to identify an image on a web page.</p>

        <p><strong>They make the web more semantic.</strong> The web is becoming increasingly semantic, meaning that the meaning of the content is becoming more explicit. This is important for many reasons, including accessibility, search engine optimization, and machine learning. Semantic elements play an important role in making the web more semantic.</p>

      <section class="article" id="article__browser">
        <h2>Do all browsers support all of the newest HTML / CSS elements?</h2>
        <p>
        No, not all browsers support all of the newest HTML/CSS elements. Older browsers may not support the latest features, and even newer browsers may not support all of the features that are currently in development.
        </p>

        <p>t is important to test your web pages in a variety of browsers to make sure that they work correctly. You can use a tool like BrowserStack to test your pages in different browsers and operating systems.</p>

        <p>Here are some resources that you can use to check the browser compatibility of HTML/CSS elements:</p>
